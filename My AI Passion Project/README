 Flawed Photo Tagger – A Vision AI Bias Explorer

This project uses the **Google Cloud Vision API** to analyze uploaded images and explore potential **biases in AI image labeling**. It's a simple but powerful tool to reflect on how AI interprets diverse visual inputs.



 Features

- Upload any image (JPG or PNG)
- Automatically retrieves and displays labels from Google Cloud Vision API
- Displays confidence scores for each label
- Built with Streamlit for a lightweight, interactive interface



Project Purpose

The goal is to help users critically explore **potential labeling bias** in commercial image recognition models — particularly across race, gender, or cultural contexts.



Example Use Cases

- Compare how similar images of people from different backgrounds are labeled.
- Analyze differences in label confidence across contexts (e.g., formal vs. casual attire).
- Detect unexpected or misleading labels that could reflect bias.



 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flawed-photo-tagger.git
cd flawed-photo-tagger

2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Google Cloud Vision API

Visit Google Cloud Console

Click "Create Project", give it a name, and save it.

Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts

Click “+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT”

Grant role: “Project > Editor” (or Vision AI User)

Create a JSON Key and download it (e.g., vision_key.json)

Move it to your project folder

4. Authenticate with your API Key:

Set the environmental variable in your terminal like shown: 
Mac/Linux: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="vision_key.json"
Windows CMD: set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=vision_key.json

In app.py, add this to the top:
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "YOUR KEY.json"

5. Run the App

In your terminal, type: streamlit run app.py

6. Take note of any bias that you find with each of the images that you add
