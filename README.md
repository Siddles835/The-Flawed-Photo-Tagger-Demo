Flawed Photo Tagger – A Vision AI Bias Explorer
Created By: Sidhaanth Kapoor (Siddles835)

This project uses **Google Cloud Vision API** to explore potential **biases in AI image labeling**. Users can upload images and inspect how Google's Vision AI classifies them — making it a powerful educational tool to reflect on fairness and representation in machine learning.

## Features

- Upload any image (JPG/PNG)
- View labels and confidence scores from Google Vision API
- Analyze AI behavior across diverse types of images
- Interface built with Streamlit for easy use

## Project Goal

To critically examine how commercial image classification models, such as Google Vision API, may exhibit **biases in labeling** based on race, gender, or context — and to promote responsible AI usage.

## Example Use Cases

- Upload diverse portraits and compare labels
- Test how AI labels images from different regions or cultures
- Observe what labels are emphasized or ignored

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flawed-photo-tagger.git
